            "A Wheelchair That Climbs Stairs\nStairs, curbs, mud and gravel are limiting obstacles for people in wheelchairs. A startup from Winterthur wants to redefine life for people with impaired mobility.\n\nScewo developed the wheelchair “Scewo BRO” that drives on two big wheels for agile maneuvering on the spot and dynamic driving over common obstacles. It comes with different modes, one of which even allows climbing stairs: Upon approaching steps, two rubber tracks under the wheelchair are extended. The chair’s seat is kept level at all time. The transitions on and off the stairs are automated. The same tracks can be used to offer more traction when navigating on slippery surfaces or to overcome bigger obstacles and steep inclines. Another interesting mode is the “Elevated Mode” in which the seat can be elevated to enable eye-to-eye communication and a better reach. “Scewo BRO” uniquely combines agility and stability and the software developers are working hard to increase the level of automatization, to help detect critical situations and to drive certain distances autonomously.",

The shoe was finally launched in early 2024, but due to unclear customer positioning and some product design issues, sales were not ideal.\n\nBased on the feedback I received from the initial sales and some market research, I plan to pivot the business. The new USP will be simpler and clearer: to create the most comfortable shoe for long-standing by utilizing state-of-the-art shoe technology and focusing on one thing - making the shoe shape like the foot for better fitting. By doing so, I plan to create a shoe that is more comfortable than your favorite slipper and can still be worn everywhere.\n\nThe prototype is currently under development and will be ready soon. I also plan to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in September to raise money for the production of the initial batch.\n\nAdditionally, the company name will be changed to Folg (Folgen der Fussform). This is why the logo and website are not yet ready.",

Conservative thinkers may not believe it, but it’s there, it works and we can show it.\nImagine a world where electricity is as safe as it is essential!\nCurrent electricity standards pose significant risks, from fire hazards to electrical shocks. Short circuits and electric shock leading to fires, damages, injuries and deaths.\nAccording to statistics, short circuits and wiring ignitions are the cause of more than 50% of all fires that do not only result in multi-billions in material damage and significant ecological harm, but also take away tens of thousands of human lives each year, so do electric shocks.\nThis is a global problem and we have found a solution.\nOur project introduces a revolutionary new standard of Safe Electricity designed to not just minimize, but completely eliminate these dangers. We’ve developed an innovative technology that dramatically enhances electrical safety, reduces accidents and protects lives, property and environment.\nThe new standard of Safe and Friendly Electricity isn’t just a concept; it’s a necessary upgrade for a safer tomorrow. With no doubt it is one of the most important breakthrough solutions of the 21st century. It will affect all the household and industrial electrical equipment worldwide that is going to run on Safe Electricity.
