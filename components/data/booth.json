            "Our pitch: At Leg&airy\u00ae we are building an AI-platform that  can autonomously fit our pre-designed smart orthopedic devices to a 3D-scan (digital twin) of a human body for common and rare neuro-orthopedic diseases. Our products are smartly produced in one of our fit-factories and are supplied to the patients directly in the clinic. Our products come with integrated sensors to learn more about patient wearing behavior and to continuously improve our proprietary fitting experience and the design of our products.\n\nProblem:\n \nHumans (and especially children) with chronic or acute neuro-orthopedic conditions tremendously suffer from badly fitted orthopedic devices - the braces don't support them the way they should or hurt them causing pressure ulcers. In some cases, orthopedic devices are supplied too late so that symptoms already worsen, or the products even injure patients due to poor fitting. This leads to massive frustration for patients who depend on orthopedic devices to retain or regain their mobility.",

It is driven by the vision that the world shall become free of diesel generators.  Its first product is a mobile battery to replace diesel generators in the building, event, and film industries. The market for green off-grid electricity solutions is growing rapidly. The serviceable market in Europe alone is estimated at 23 bn EUR. The business has very direct environmental benefits as the replaced diesel generators produce about 70% more CO2 per kWh than a coal-fired power plant. Hence, emost will sell units over the next five years with a lifetime CO2 reduction of 930\u2019000 tons.\nThe founding team has successfully worked together for several years, bringing key experience in engineering, sales, analytics, business management, as well as founding and growing start-ups in the climate change area to the unicorn status.",

A surfboard that can be produced with recycled materials and be fully recycled again. Therefore, we now have the possibility to achieve our goal of a closed loop production chain and make the sport of surfing even more sustainable. These kind of soft-top surfboards are going to be unique to the European surf market. We are looking forward to showcasing this new surfboard at the start up night, to receive as much feedback as possible from all the different companies and individuals and gain new insights to further improve ourselves.",

With Candli, a person with no prior training can scan their own drawings and pictures and, with only a handful of visual rules, assemble them into a fully-functional video game. In one click, they can then share their game online with friends.\n\nOur vision is that Candli becomes a transmedia game ecosystem in which the player takes the role of a game creator, gently being given the key skills to become a creative hero builder. This ecosystem will feature multiple tiers suited for various ages, starting with an interactive colouring book for young children, up to advanced features such as mathematical functions for older ones. Hence, Candli will provide a support for education, in the fields of development of personal creativity, video game design and history, computer science, mathematics, physics, and others.",

            "Rapidata solves a fundamental problem faced by the modern AI industry. AI tools and systems, like ChatGPT, autonomous driving or magic erase, rely on massive amounts of data and the secret of the industry is that this data needs to be filtered, annotated and validated by enormous amounts of repetitive human labor in low cost countries. This is slow, expensive, and most of all, not scalable. Rapidata solves this by not relying on a fixed workforce, instead we have an existing network of Millions of People around the world that we can access through the same technology as digital ads. This allows us to offer 1000x faster human-verified data processing at scale, while being more affordable than the competition. At the same time we offer a revolutionary new way to monetize free web services!",

By better mobilising leisure groups for events of companies, associations and organisations, SUNNYCLOCK can access the communities of these future customers and subsequently generate revenue via a freemium model and sales commissions (=event-driven community management model).\n\u2022\tWith this concept, SUNNYCLOCK has been convincing one new potential customer (pioneer) per week with 20% sales FTEs since 06.05.2023. \n\u2022\tThese pioneers will help with the marketing of the SUNNYCLOCK app in the upcoming months. Already, the communities of our pioneer partners unite more than 10,000 people and we are just starting to approach larger pioneer partners like www.asvz.ch , www.bckzh.ch, municipals in Horgen areas too any more to soon unite a wider pool of potential users through our partners.",

It understands your existing workflows and automatically prepares the extracted data in such a way that you can find them again quickly.\u200b\n\nThe hotdok hot-mapper enables seamless connection to your existing system landscape. The hotdok API transmits the extracted data records to your ERP, for example, so that customer and order numbers, item data, invoice details or handwritten notes are saved exactly where you previously had to enter them by hand. \u200b\n\nDocuments with more complex input processes, the hotdok A.I. train using powerful OCR algorithms. In this way, hotdok learns your individual requirements and integrates itself more strongly into your company structure with each use and optimizes your workflow.\n\nVisit our booth and learn how hotdok can take your business to the next level.

Moreover, no concrete health prevention plan is being implemented to avoid long and frequent sick leaves, albeit statistics showing the urgent need to do so. Gregory and Fabian saw these two gaps in the insurance market and decided to address them by founding grape in 2021 and creating the first fully digital employee insurance that improves employees health. To date, grape counts 12 employees and a couple hundred employees insured by it. \nGrape offers various insurance products (KTG, UVG(Z), and BVG) bundled with an end-to-end digital user interface that allows our clients to manage their policy, submit claims, and view various analytics with just a few clicks, saving them time and resources. \nIncluded with our insurance products, our customers get access to the grape\u2019s health platform, through which they can profit from several products and services that promote their employees\u2019 physical and mental health. Our health benefits cover various parts of a company\u2019s and of an individual's well-being: ranging from therapy sessions and coaching retreats to workout apps, gym subscriptions and CHM, as well as self-care products and sports equipment.",

Current consolidation treatment with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), is effective but associated with high risks, including severe complications, reduced quality of life, and low survival rates. Furthermore, old and comorbid AML and MDS patients are not eligible for allo-HCT and face a very short survival (<1 year).\n\nOur solution, ALY117, is a novel CD117xCD3 bispecific antibody. It targets CD117, which is expressed on both normal and malignant hematologic cells. ALY117 engages T cells, facilitating their binding to CD117+ cells and activation, ultimately leading to T cell-mediated killing of these cells. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to current conditioning regiments, reaching a \"sweetspot\" between safety and efficacy and ultimately reduce complications associated with allo-HSCT.",

Pacioli, unser fortschrittliches Cloud-Auswertungstool, integriert sich standardisiert und skalierbar nahtlos in bestehende ERP-Systeme und verwendet KI, um detaillierte Einblicke in die Rentabilit\u00e4t Ihrer Gesch\u00e4ftsbereiche zu liefern. Aber wir gehen noch einen Schritt weiter: Mit Amortec Virtual Reality bringen wir die Pr\u00e4sentation und Interpretation von Finanzdaten auf eine neue Ebene. Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie k\u00f6nnen Ihre Finanzen in einer virtuellen Realit\u00e4t visualisieren und analysieren, was eine tiefere und intuitivere Verst\u00e4ndigung erm\u00f6glicht. In Kombination mit unserer Odoo-Partnerschaft bieten wir eine umfassende ERP-Business-L\u00f6sung, die alle Aspekte Ihres Unternehmens abdeckt. Und dabei bleiben wir mit Amormind unseren Werten wie Integrit\u00e4t, Kreativit\u00e4t und Vertrauen treu, die wir in alles einflie\u00dfen lassen, was wir tun, denn unternehmerische Performance reduziert sich nicht nur auf die finanzielle Komponente. Mittelfristig ist es unser Ziel ein neues ERP-System zu entwickeln. Es ist unsere Antwort auf die Frage, wie das Business und die Interaktion zwischen ERP und User im n\u00e4chsten Jahrzehnt aussehen wird. Bei AMORTEC schauen wir \u00fcber traditionelle Bedienkonzepte mit Bildschirm, Maus und Tastatur hinaus. Unsere mehrdimensionale Auswertungsfunktion sind zudem durch die menschliche DNA-Funktionsweise inspiriert. ",

            "Despite a growing number of FDA-approved cancer drugs half of all cancer\npatients do not respond or become resistant to treatment. The reason for\nthe poor outcomes of many cancer patients is not the unavailability of drugs,\nbut the fact that oncologists lack the tools to choose the most suitable\ntreatment for each patient among the available options. At the same time,\nmany clinical trials fail due to a lack of information to identify responders to\nnovel drugs. How do we bring the right drug to each patient?\n\nWe have developed a highly informative approach to analyze tumor tissue\nbased on spatial single-cell proteomics. We have demonstrated the\nusefulness of our approach to provide personalized treatment decision\nsupport for clinicians and to provide valuable insight to accelerate oncology\ndrug development. Our vision is to create a digital tumor based on hundreds\nof thousands of spatial single-cell tumor profiles with associated clinical\nand treatment outcome data, which will allow us to continuously improve\nour recommendations to clinical and pharma partners and discover novel\nbiomarkers.",
