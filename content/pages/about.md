      The Startup Nights is comparable to a huge family reunion for the entire
      startup ecosystem. Where everyone belongs and feels at home.


      But as the startup family grows, it needs a bigger home. That is why
      Startup Nights aim to get bigger and better every year.


      ### A team on a mission


      We are a team of 45 passionate people, many of us are entrepreneurs
      ourselves, and we organize Startup Nights 2022 in our spare time. Purely
      out of passion.


      We are convinced that startups and innovation must be much more present
      and valued in Switzerland – because they shape the future.


      With Startup Nights, we want the Swiss startup ecosystem to grow. Further,
      we want to create awareness for startups and their innovations with an
      impact far beyond the startup scene.


      ### Impressions


      The family grew from 1000 to 8000 visitors in 5 years. We helped the
      community to connect, grow, and get inspired – year after year at the
      Startup Nights.
