              Keynote speeches, panels and fireside chats are all 25 minutes
              long. However, the keynote usually is only one person where as the
              panel and fireside chats include multiple people and a moderator
              who leads through the discussions.

              the corresponding person.

              In the design of your booth, you are really unrestricted.
              (However, we are not the biggest fans of tall exhibition walls
              around the whole booth) Please bring at least a rollup with you so
              that people can see and recognize you. Please help us that people
              will love your stand and the whole event. Be creative in what you
              show and do on your booth: Show your products, show real customer
              cases, excite people with games…

              We want to make sure you have everything you need for an amazing
              booth and that we can place it on the best possible space.
              Therefore, it would be advantageous if you could send us some
              additional information about the bigger items you want to bring or
              send us a sketch of the booth
