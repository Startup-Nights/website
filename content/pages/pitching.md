          Pre-Seed: companies that are working on solving a problem and have not
          yet reached product-market-fit
        - >-
          Seed:companies that have first customers, ideally have revenue or
          other meaningful traction and believe they have reached
          product-market-fit
        - >-
          The pitch is expected to be delivered in English. We likely will run a
          format of a 5 min Pitch & 10 min Q&A. Details will follow. The jury
          will preview and nominate the startups that will get invited to pitch.

          We are already very much looking forward to your application! We will
          be happy to inform you as soon as possible whether you can pitch on
          stage or not.
        - 'Either way, we wish you much success with your startup!'
