          the end of 2017 and subsequently as Chairman of the Board of Directors
          until the end of 2021. He no longer holds a function in a governing
          body.


          Besides being a pioneer in the crypto-financial services industry,
          Niklas Nikolajsen has been named to the prestigious list of Top 100
          Bankers in Switzerland by BILANZ Magazine four times.
