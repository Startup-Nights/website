      - name: Niklas Nikolajsen von Karlshof
        position: Founder Bitcoin Suisse AG
        description: >
          Niklas Nikolajsen von Karlshof founded Bitcoin Suisse AG in mid-2013.
          Niklas has a background of more than 15 years as a professional
          software architect & software developer, primarily in the financial,
          manufacturing, and public sectors.


          In 2010 after discovering Bitcoin, he became one of the early
          adopters, investors, and proponents of crypto assets. In 2011 he moved
          from Denmark to Switzerland and worked for a major Swiss financial
          institution, as a consultant until he founded Bitcoin Suisse AG in
          2013, together with partners. He served as CEO of the company until
          the end of 2017 and subsequently as Chairman of the Board of Directors
          until the end of 2021. He no longer holds a function in a governing
          body.


          Besides being a pioneer in the crypto-financial services industry,
          Niklas Nikolajsen has been named to the prestigious list of Top 100
          Bankers in Switzerland by BILANZ Magazine four times.


          Niklas Nikolajsen holds a degree in computer science from the
          Copenhagen Business School. He is widely regarded as one of the
          pioneers of the Swiss crypto-financial sector, having founded the
          first Swiss company in this space.

          the Internet and e-commerce and is now the largest independent online
          retailer in Switzerland.


          In addition to online retail, the promotion of startups and
          entrepreneurship in Switzerland are close to his heart. That is why he
          has been involved in "Die Höhle der Löwen Schweiz" since 2019.
