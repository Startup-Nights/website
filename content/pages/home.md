          Last year we had the first edition of two days in a new location. And
          it was awesome! 42 speakers, 500 founders, and 8000 visitors made the
          Startup Nights 2022 unforgettable. 
        - >-
          As we already started with the preaparations for this year's event, we
          also like to take a look back.
