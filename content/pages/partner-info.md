              You may have booked the "Partner Tickets" module when you booked
              your Partner Package. This means that you have a certain number of
              tickets included in your package. In this case, you have received
              the code to get your free tickets from the partner team. 
            - >-
              If you have not selected the ticket module, you do not have any
              free tickets included. You have to buy your tickets separatly.
            - >-
              In case you selected the ticket module but didn't get a discount
              code yet, please get in touch with our partner team.

            - >-
              In the design of your booth you are really unrestricted. Please
              bring at least a rollup with you that people can see and recognize
              you. Please help us that people will love your stand and the whole
              event. Be creative what you show and do on your booth: Show your
              products, show real customer cases, excite people with games, … 
            - >-
              There will be a bar table with two bar chairs and a 230V power
              connection. Based on your booked package you have 3x3m space if
              not stated otherwise in your Receipt. Your booth will not
              necessarily have a back wall.
            - >-
              For special equipment or add-ons to enhance your booth, we’ve
              partnered with Bexpo. You can rent your equipment directly from
              them.
            - >-
              In general we mix Startups and corporates as we think this will
              make the whole booth much more interesting.

              Material (Un)Loading: The parking lot can be used for unloading.
              On the side of the hall will be a large gate into which you can
              enter directly into the exhibition hall. Don’t park before this
              gate as everybody has to bring things through it. Large things
              like cars must be brought early in the morning or the evening
              before so that you can get through everywhere. The same also
              applies for when you dismantle the booth.
