                    In the design of your booth you are really unrestricted.
                    Please bring at least a rollup with you that people can see
                    and recognize you. Please help us that people will love your
                    stand and the whole event. Be creative what you show and do
                    on your booth: Show your products, show real customer cases,
                    excite people with games, …

                    There will be a bar table with two bar chairs and a 230V
                    power connection. Based on your booked package you have 3x3m
                    space if not stated otherwise in your Receipt. Your booth
                    will not necessarily have a back wall.

                    For special equipment or add-ons to enhance your booth,

                    Material (Un)Loading: The parking lot can be used for
                    unloading. On the side of the hall will be a large gate into
                    which you can enter directly into the exhibition hall. Don’t
                    park before this gate as everybody has to bring things
                    through it. Large things like cars must be brought early in
                    the morning or the evening before so that you can get
                    through everywhere. The same also applies for when you
                    dismantle the booth.

                    Don’t park before this gate as everybody has to bring things

                    the morning or the evening before so that you can get
                    through everywhere. The same also applies for when you
