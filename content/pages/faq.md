                    on your booth: Show your products, show real customer cases,

                    Material (Un)Loading: The parking lot can be used for

                    which you can enter directly into the exhibition hall. Don’t
                    park before this gate as everybody has to bring things
                    through it. Large things like cars must be brought early in
                    the morning or the evening before so that you can get
                    through everywhere. The same also applies for when you
                    dismantle the booth.

                    the morning or the evening before so that you can get
