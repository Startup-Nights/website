          As usual, after two intense and networking-rich days of the expo, the obligatory After-Party will take place on Friday evening. This year, we've planned something special: the official After-Party of the Startup Nights will be held at a separate location. With this, we aim to offer you an even better party experience in a suitable environment with higher quality.

          The After-Party is the perfect opportunity to deepen existing connections and make new ones. We want to use this opportunity to reflect on the past two days of the expo, celebrate, and wrap up the Startup Nights in a relaxed atmosphere. Many other founders will be there, eager to network in a casual setting and toast to two successful days.

          The party will take place at the Caribbean Pearl, a venue directly at Winterthur train station. Spaces are limited, so make sure to secure your ticket for this year's After-Party as soon as possible!

          DJ Patric Pleasure & Gee-K skilfully combine ‘The Best Of Both Worlds’ by merging live music and DJ set as ‘DJandGuitar’ to create a rousing performance. This creates the feeling of a live band - simply with a more diverse selection of songs and different music genres from RnB & Soul to Hip Hop to Disco & Funk to Rock, chart hits and pumping NuDisco beats.
