        text:
          - >-

            your business only and may not be re-sold, forwarded or transferred
            for commercial gain under any circumstances. Where there has been

            visiting rights has the right to demand access to the event. That
            person’s name is a component part of the ticket. The legal validity

            provision of the various names of ticketholders upon purchase, as
            the tickets will be issued immediately following the purchase
            process in the names that you provided. It is not possible to

          - >-
            4.4 No part of the website or matchmaking application of Startup

            event (e.g. war, environmental influences, catastrophes, unrest,
            piety, terrorism dangers, epidemics, pandemics [incl. COVID-19],
            prohibition of the authorities, etc.) or for other circumstances for
            which Startup Nights is not responsible, the ticket shall be valid
            for the next edition of the Startup Nights. Startup Nights does not
            hold itself liable for any other expenses incurred, except in cases
            of intentional acts or omissions or gross negligence. Startup Nights
            strives to notify its customers of force majeure cases as quickly as
            possible.

            6.2 A refund of the tickets is only possible up to 14 days before
            the event, if you have purchased the wrong ticket. If the ticket is
            not returned within the time limit, no refund is possible.
            Additional claims are excluded. Thus, only the ticket price is
            refundable. In the event of a no-show (the ticket owner does not
            follow the event), there will be no refund of the ticket price.
          - >-

            shall be refunded. If you cancel less than three weeks before the
            event, no refund will be possible.
          - >-
            6.4 In case of events lasting more than one day, the first day of
            the event shall be deemed to be the beginning of the event. 
      - title: 7. LIABILITY
        text:
          - >-
            7.1 The Participant assumes sole responsibility for the visit of the
            event. Startup Nights cannot be held liable for indirect and/or

            failure to fulfill its obligations under the General Terms and

            the provision of the services specified in the General Terms and
            Conditions as well as in further agreements between the Participant

          - >-
            7.4 Startup Nights reserves the right to refuse admission to any

            participant, unless Startup Nights has caused the defect in the
            provision through gross negligence or intentionally. Startup Nights
            cannot be held liable for any loss or harm suffered by the
            Participant or by any third parties as the result of failure to (i)
            access the website, (ii) the internet, (iii) the communication
            media, and (iv) more generally, due to a force majeure event, as
            defined in the case law of the Swiss courts, during a visit to the

            against Startup Nights on the grounds of breach by the Participant
            of any of the provisions of the General Terms and Conditions,
            Startup Nights will be entitled to bring third-party proceedings
            against the Participant.

            damage once received or collected, and complying with event-specific
            rules and regulations. Startup Nights is not responsible for any
            issues or delays related to ticket delivery. Refunds and exchanges
