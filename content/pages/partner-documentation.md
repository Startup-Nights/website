              Material (Un)Loading: The parking lot can be used for unloading.
              On the side of the hall will be a large gate into which you can
              enter directly into the exhibition hall. Don’t park before this
              gate as everybody has to bring things through it. Large things
              like cars must be brought early in the morning or the evening
              before so that you can get through everywhere. The same also
              applies for when you dismantle the booth.
